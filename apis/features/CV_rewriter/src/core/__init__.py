## /src/core: handling CV obtaining for backend *not upload* and parsing and storing in /db
## we'll use docling for now

## CVs are downloaded from user and stored to local disk (temporarily) in backend logic, not here
## this is just for parsing and storing in db

## not sure if we will store user CVs permanently
